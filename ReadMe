 /*  FIRST:  MainMenu3. Being able to create an Account.  Already Can do it with Regex email working.
            Now I need to connect it to the UI.(frontend and backend ?See the Intro video for reference to the layout)
            THEN:  AdminMenu1. See all Customers as Admin
            THEN:  AdminMenu4. Being Able to Add a Room as Admin
            THEN:  AdminMenu2. See all Rooms created.

            THEN:  MainMenu1. Deciding whether to be a Guest or Customer.  Search feature for dates in finding a room?
            Being able to reserve the room.  Single customer per a check-in and check-out date range.  Search for recommended rooms
            if no available rooms for the customers date range.


            THEN:  MainMenu2. displaying the reservation to the Customer.

            AdminMenu3.See All Reservations


12/22 definitely confused about how the functions should be through each part of the app.  Main menu and also customer service and customer classes.
